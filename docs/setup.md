# Setting up a Server

```{warning}
Murder Run only supports **Minecraft 1.21.7** as of right now. If you choose any other version, the plugin will **not**
start-up, and it will break. Make sure to choose **Paper 1.21.7** for now. Support for future versions will be added as
fast as possible.
```

To set up Murder Run, you will need two things:
1) A Minecraft Bukkit-Based Server
2) A Murder Run Plugin JAR

## Setting up a Bukkit-Based Server
In order to get a Minecraft Bukkit-based Server, you need to download either Spigot, Paper, or any other Bukkit-fork
software. I recommend downloading [Paper](https://papermc.io/) -- it's also the software I develop against actively
for Murder Run.

To set up a Paper server, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started) that Paper
has posted on their website. It includes a very detailed step-by-step guide to set up the server onto your computer,
and how to add plugins

## Getting Murder Run
Murder Run is like any other plugin, where you just drag and drop the JAR file into the plugins folder. There isn't any
set up required, and Murder Run will download the necessary dependencies for you. You can find bleeding-edge releases
on the TeamCity CI [here](https://ci.brandonli.me/repository/download/murderrun/.lastFinished/MurderRun-1.21.7-v1.0.0-all.jar),
which are created pretty frequently. You should always use the latest Murder Run JAR, as it contains many more bug fixes 
and version compatability than the previous.

## Dependencies
Murder Run has three essential dependencies, [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit), [Citizens](https://citizensnpcs.co/),
and [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents). All are necessary in order for the plugin to function.
Murder Run will automatically download these plugins for you on start-up, but in the case that they aren't downloaded
for some reason, make sure to download all three plugins and drop them into the plugins folder so Murder Run is able
to load.

Murder Run also hooks into several other plugins, like Libsdisguises, PlaceholderAPI, Parties, Nexo, Citizens, and many
other plugins for features. You are able to see some of these features later on.
