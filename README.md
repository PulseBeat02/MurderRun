If you are familiar with the game Dead by Daylight (DBD), you will be familiar with Murder Run. Murder Run is based off
the concept in DBD, an advanced game-mode revolving around two groups: killers and survivors. In a desolate map, survivors
must find all vehicle parts scattered everywhere and throw them back on the truck before the killers murder everyone or
the timer runs out.
